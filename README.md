This file contains:
- 6 different types of classifiers: KNN, MNB, RF, GBC, SVM, & MLP
- Each used 4-fold cross validation(some used StratifiedKFold)
- Each only used accuracy to measure parameters
- Many different options for normalization across the 6 classifiers(no preprocessing, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, Mean-Sigma, Median-MAD, & robustScaler)
- 2 different types of feature selection used only on KNN, MNB, RF, and GBC
- Other items: showed other graphs throughout the code file(trees/feature importance/probability graphs/heat maps/etc)
